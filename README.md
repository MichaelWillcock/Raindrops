### Project Outline
This project was created for the purpose of making a function that would return a string based off of an integer input parameter.

If the integer input was a multiple of 3 the function would return the string "Pling". If the integer was a multiple of 5 the function would return the string "Plang". If the integer was a multiple of 7 the function would return the string "Plong".

The function would was also return multiple combinations of the words if the integer was a multiple of more than one number. For example, if the integer was 15, a multiple of both 5 and 3, the function would return "PlingPlang" and if the integer was 35, a multiple of 5 and 7, the function would return "PlangPlong" and so on and so forth.

Finally, if the integer was not a multiple of 3, 5, or 7 the function would instead return the input integer.
